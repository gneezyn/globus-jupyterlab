    * Defines the various, Globus-specific, interfaces used throughout the project.
* [Search](../../../src/globus/api/search.ts)
    * Implements various functions for the Search feature, which allows users to search for endpoints.
    * Used by the [Search](../../../src/globus/widgets/search.ts) widget.
* [Transfer](../../../src/globus/api/transfer.ts)
    * Implements various functions for the Transfer feature, which allows users to transfer files from one endpoint to another.
    * Used by both the [Activity](../../../src/globus/widgets/activity.ts) and [File Manager](../../../src/globus/widgets/file_manager.ts) widgets.

### Widgets Directory (src/globus/widgets/)
Main directory for defining the widgets. Contains the following files:
* [Activity](../../../src/globus/widgets/activity.ts)
